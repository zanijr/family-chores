# Active Context - Family Chore App

## Current Work Focus
Building a comprehensive, self-hosted family chore management application based on the user's existing GitHub project (https://github.com/zanijr/WebApp) with significant enhancements for production deployment and mobile optimization.

## Project Status: ‚úÖ CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING
**Current Phase**: Core functionality issues fixed
**Status**: Registration works and chore management functionality now working

## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Architecture
- **Enhanced Existing Codebase**: Using user's proven architecture as foundation rather than complete rebuild
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 8080 for nginx proxy manager integration
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 (user preference confirmed)
- **Authentication**: Simple JWT-based system (no 2FA/social login required)
- **Mobile Strategy**: PWA approach for cross-platform compatibility

### Infrastructure Decisions
- **Server**: 192.168.12.99 (user's internal server)
- **Domain**: family.bananas4life.com (already configured with SSL)
- **SSL**: Handled by user's existing nginx proxy manager
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for easy deployment and management
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups (no specific location preference)
